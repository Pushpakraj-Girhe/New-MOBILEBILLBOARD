Recommended Locations & Timing Windows:**\n\nThis plan focuses on high-traffic areas frequented by the target demographic, prioritizing visibility during peak hours.  The budget constraint necessitates a focus on key areas rather than city-wide coverage.\n\n* **Daytime (10:00 AM - 6:00 PM):**\n    * **Koregaon Park:** High concentration of young professionals and students.  Focus on roads like North Main Road & South Main Road.\n    * **Viman Nagar:** Popular for its restaurants and IT professionals.  Target areas around the Phoenix Marketcity mall and the main roads.\n    * **Baner:**  Growing residential and commercial hub with a young population.  Focus on the main road and areas near Balewadi High Street.\n    * **Symbiosis College Road:** High student population.\n* **Evening (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM):**\n    * **Koregaon Park:**  Nightlife and dining scene.\n    * **JM Road (near FC Road):** Popular hangout spot for young adults.\n    * **MG Road:** High pedestrian traffic in the evening.\n\n\n**2. Optimal Routes for Maximum Visibility:**\n\nThe routes below are suggestions and can be adjusted based on real-time traffic and billboard visibility.  Looping routes within each area are recommended to maximize exposure.\n\n* **Route 1 (Koregaon Park & Viman Nagar):** North Main Road (Koregaon Park) ->  Eon IT Park (Viman Nagar) -> Phoenix Marketcity (Viman Nagar) -> Back to Koregaon Park via main roads.\n* **Route 2 (Baner & Symbiosis):**  Balewadi High Street (Baner) ->  Symbiosis College Road ->  Main Baner Road ->  Back to Balewadi High Street.\n* **Route 3 (Evening Route):** JM Road -> FC Road ->  MG Road -> Koregaon Park (nightlife areas)\n\n\n**3. Estimated Impressions per Day:**\n\nGiven the budget constraints, achieving a very high number of impressions per day is unlikely. A realistic estimate considering the chosen locations and traffic density would be:\n\n* **Conservative Estimate:** 5,000 - 7,000 impressions per day.\n* **Optimistic Estimate:** 8,000 - 10,000 impressions per day (depending on traffic and billboard placement).\n\n\n**4. Special Considerations:**\n\n* **Billboard Design:**  The design needs to be eye-catching, easily readable, and include the cafe's name, location, and possibly a compelling offer (e.g., discount coupon).\n* **Permits & Regulations:**  Ensure all necessary permits for mobile billboard advertising in Pune are obtained.  Regulations regarding routes and timings might apply.\n* **Traffic & Weather:**  Flexibility is crucial.  Adjust routes based on traffic congestion and adverse weather conditions.  Consider having an alternate plan for rainy days.\n* **Driver Safety:**  Prioritize driver safety.  Ensure the driver is experienced with navigating Pune's traffic and follows all traffic rules.\n* **Budget Allocation:**  Negotiate a competitive rate with the mobile billboard advertising provider. The ₹10,000 budget might need careful allocation across the seven days to cover rental, driver fees, and permits. Consider a smaller, more targeted area for the 7 days instead of a wider reach with a reduced effect.\n\n\n**Note:** These are estimates.  Actual impressions may vary.  It's highly recommended to work with a local advertising agency in Pune to optimize the campaign and get more accurate estimations. They can also help navigate permits and regulations more efficiently.\n","routePlanDays45":[{"location":"Start at Aundh","time":"12:00 PM"},{"location":"Move to Hinjewadi IT Park","time":"2:30 PM"},{"location":"Continue to Koregaon Park","time":"4:00 PM"},{"location":"End at FC Road","time":"6:00 PM"}],"routePlanDays67":[{"location":"Start at FC Road","time":"5:00 PM"},{"location":"Move to Aundh","time":"6:30 PM"},{"location":"Continue to Koregaon Park","time":"8:00 PM"},{"location":"End route at Hinjewadi IT Park","time":"10:00 PM"}],"duration":"1 week","targetAudience":"18-40","timings":[{"description":"Morning commute hours","time":"8:00 AM - 10:00 AM"},{"description":"Lunch break period","time":"12:00 PM - 2:00 PM"},{"description":"Evening rush hour and leisure time","time":"5:00 PM - 8:00 PM"}],"location":"Pune","locations":[{"name":"Koregaon Park","description":"High-end shopping area with affluent visitors"},{"name":"FC Road","description":"Popular with college students and young professionals"},{"name":"Aundh","description":"Residential area with shopping complexes"},{"name":"Hinjewadi IT Park","description":"Tech hub with young professionals"}],"visibilityHeatmap":[{"visibility":75,"time":"Morning (8-11 AM)"},{"visibility":60,"time":"Midday (11 AM-2 PM)"},{"visibility":50,"time":"Afternoon (2-5 PM)"},{"visibility":85,"time":"Evening (5-8 PM)"},{"visibility":70,"time":"Night (8-11 PM)"}],"businessType":"Restros and cafes","budget":"10000","timestamp":"2025-03-27T09:24:38.758+00:00"}
